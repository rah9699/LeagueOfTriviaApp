Plans: 
* Look through the Dota 2 and Smite APIs. Attempt to get at least one of them functioning in the Sandbox. If I can't, scour for a third-party resource.
        
Hmm. The scripting API requires Lua, and frankly I'm not sure if it works outside of Dota 2 proper. Smite API seems...out of reach. 

Alright: plan B seems to be "compare your Dota and League games," since that sounds like a feasible use of the Dota API.

I can try to use "ancient magicks" to grab stuff from the game directly, but I don't think I have time--and plan B sounds more feasible (but significantly less cool...alright, it's still cool, but I'm miffed that my original plan doesn't sound like it will work.)

I could also combine this with some sort of server that holds data to make suggestions based on what people tend to play? (reliability of said server depends on whether players can log in from both games.)
